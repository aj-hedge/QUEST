- QUEST: QUerying, Extraction and Survey Tool
- WASD Kit: Wide-Area Survey Data Kit

Currently designed for retrieving the deepest images in a given band from a given archive, and prioritising the deepest images in a given band (with compromise for better resolution) from the ones indexed on-disk. Future development could lead to a separate deep-prioritised mode for continuum and a cadence-prioritised mode for transient lightcurves.
